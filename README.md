# Text_Indexing: (algorithms & data structures II)
For a given document an online index is created using a binary search tree (where each node contains the word searched for) and a linked list that contains the line number of the transcript where the word occurs.

The program filters the words based on input to treat upper and lower case the same, remove punctuation marks, and not store numerical data as words. document1.txt could be used as an input file example.

make all - To compile all sections.

make clean - To remove all *.o and executable files.
